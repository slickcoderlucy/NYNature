    <h2>Catskills</h2>
    <p>The Catskill Mountains lie in southeastern New York State and contain the Catskill Forest Preserve,
       which has lots of wildlife and hiking trails. The mountains there are Hunter Mountain and Belleayre Mountain.
       These mountains have ski resorts in the winter. They also have rich cultural festivals in the summer and
       fall, such as the East Durham Irish festival and the Oktoberfest for 4 weekends at Hunter Mountain,
       and the Belleayre music festival in the summer. The Catskills used to be the home of many resorts that
       offered great meals and activities for families, and entertainment. When I was young, my parents took
       my sister and me there for a vacation every summer. Those are my favorite memories!
